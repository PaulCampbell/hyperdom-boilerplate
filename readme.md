There's no server... This is just for your front ends.

  * Hyperdom single page app with a couple of views
  * Service worker... offline first, yeah?
  * Testing setup with [browser-monkey](https://github.com/featurist/browser-monkey "Browser Monkey") (It's fast and it's ace!)
  * Less for styles
  * ES6 transpiling and JSX transformations using Babel
  * Module bundling with Browserify
